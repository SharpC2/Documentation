# Detection

The SharpC2 repository contains a YARA file with several rules highlighting indicators that are unique to SharpC2.  In most cases, these indicators have been purposely embedded to aid such detection, and are only effective if the tool's source code has not been modified to remove them.

More explicit examples will be added here over time.

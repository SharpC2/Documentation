## Custom C2 Handlers

A C2 Handler is a means by which a Drone communicates with the Team Server (and one day Drone-to-Drone as well).

### TeamServer

A Handler can be implemented directly into the existing TeamServer project or as a standalone DLL.  The advantage of a DLL is that it's more easily shareable.

Create a .NET Class Library and add the TeamServer as a reference.
Create your new handler class and have it inherit from ``Handler``.

Your job is to provide overrides for ``Name``, ``Parameters``, ``Start`` and ``Stop``.

- ``Name`` is the name of the handler as it appears in the client.
- ``Parameters`` is a list of ``HandlerParameter``.  Each parameter has a name, a default value and whether or not it's optional.  These parameters appear in the client when configuring the handler.
- Even though ``Start`` is a ``virtual``, it should be overridden and ``base.Start();`` called before anything else.  The base implementation ensures that all mandatory parameters have been supplied before continuing.

When a Drone "checks-in", you should recover the ``DroneMetadata`` and pass it to ``TaskService.GetDroneTasks(metadata);`` to get any tasks pending for it.
Equally, if the Drone is "sending data", it should be reconstructed to an ``IEnumerable<C2Message>`` and passed to ``TaskService.RecvC2Data(messages);``.

Once compiled, you can start the team server like: ``sudo ./TeamServer [password] </path/to/custom-handler.dll>`` to load it.

### Drone

Presently, custom handlers for the Drone can only be implemented directly within the Drone project.  However, implementation is practically identical.  Create a new handler class, inherit from ``Handler`` and provide overrides for ``Name``, ``Start`` and ``Stop``.

```{admonition} Important!
:class: warning

It's vital that the matching Handlers on the team server and Drone have the same ``Name``.
This is used by dnlib to embed the parameters from the correct Handler on the team server into the Drone during payload generation.
```

To check if there are any messages to send, use ``OutboundQueue.IsEmpty``.  If false, get an ``IEnumerable<C2Message>`` with ``GetOutboundQueue()``.  This data can be transformed into whatever format is appropriate for your Handler.
After talking to the team server and receiving an ``IEnumerable<C2Message>``, iterate over each one and call ``InboundQueue.Enqueue(message)`` for them to be processed by the Drone.

You will then need to compile the Drone to a new DLL (with the Release configuration) and place it in the team server's ``Resources`` directory:  [https://github.com/SharpC2/SharpC2/tree/main/TeamServer/Resources](https://github.com/SharpC2/SharpC2/tree/main/TeamServer/Resources)


## Custom Drone Modules

Drone modules can be used to provide additional functionality to a Drone.  As with Handlers, a module can be written directly into the Drone or as a standalone DLL.
If implemented as a standalone DLL, these can be pushed to the Drone during runtime (via the ``load-module`` command in the client).

Create a new .NET (Framework) Class Library and add the Drone project as a reference.

Create your drone module class and inherit from ``DroneModule``.  A single module can have multiple commands.  The ``name`` and ``description`` of each command will be shown in the client.

![](demo-command.png)

You may add arguments to a command like:

```c#
public override List<Command> Commands => new List<Command>()
{
    new ("demo", "A demo command", ExecuteDemoCommand, new List<Command.Argument>
    {
        new("pid", optional: false)
    })
};
```

An argument has a label, can be optional or mandatory, and can be an artefact.  An artefact is a data blob sent with the task (think `execute-assembly` etc).

```text
[7c7a5403ed] # load-module /Users/rasta/Desktop/DemoModule.dll
[+] Drone tasked: b3b6615656

[7c7a5403ed] # [+] Drone checked in. Sent 6924 bytes.
[+] Output received:
Module DemoModule loaded.
[+] Task complete.
```

Once the module is loaded, the new command(s) will be available.

```text
[7c7a5403ed] # help

Name              Description
----              -----------
test              This is a test

Usage: test

[+] Drone tasked: acb1c6aa43
[7c7a5403ed] # [+] Drone checked in. Sent 89 bytes.
[+] Output received:

[+] Task complete.
```

### API Hooking

The Drone is compiled with [MinHook.NET](https://github.com/CCob/MinHook.NET), the engine for which is exposed as a protected field within the `DroneModule` abstract class, called `Hooks`.

You must define a delegate and a detour method.  It's also a good idea to store a reference to the original hooked function so it can be restored.  A complete implemention could look something like this:

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Threading;

using Drone.Models;
using Drone.Modules;

namespace Drone
{
    public class DemoModule : DroneModule
    {
        public override string Name => "demo-module";

        public override List<Command> Commands => new List<Command>()
        {
            new ("hook-msgbox", "Hook the MessageBox API", HookMessageBox),
            new ("unhook-msgbox", "UnHook the MessageBox API", UnHookMessageBox)
        };

        private MessageBoxWDelegate _messageBoxWOriginal;

        private void HookMessageBox(DroneTask task, CancellationToken token)
        {
            _messageBoxWOriginal ??= Hooks.CreateHook(
                "user32.dll",
                "MessageBoxW",
                new MessageBoxWDelegate(MessageBoxWDetour));

            Hooks.EnableHook(_messageBoxWOriginal);
        }
        
        private void UnHookMessageBox(DroneTask task, CancellationToken token)
        {
            if (_messageBoxWOriginal is not null)
            {
                Hooks.DisableHook(_messageBoxWOriginal);
            }
        }

        private int MessageBoxWDetour(IntPtr hWnd, string text, string caption, uint type)
            => _messageBoxWOriginal(hWnd, "HOOKED!", caption, type);

        [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.StdCall, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]
        private delegate int MessageBoxWDelegate(IntPtr hWnd, string text, string caption, uint type);
    }
}
```
